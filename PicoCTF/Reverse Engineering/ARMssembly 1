# 1. ARMssembly 1

For what argument does this program print `win` with variables 68, 2 and 3? File: chall_1.S Flag format: picoCTF{XXXXXXXX} -> (hex, lowercase, no 0x, and 32 bits. ex. 5614267 would be picoCTF{0055aabb})

## Solution:
first we made the space for the stack variables. stack + 16 we moved 68 stack +16 moved 2 stack +24 moved 3.
load 2 in w0 and load 68 in w1
lsl left bit shift operator. shifter 2 bits towards left from 68 ans=272 and load this in stack +28
load 272 in w1 and load 3 in w0
sdiv operator to divide 272/3 ans= 90
laod 90 in w1 and user input in w0
in main function we see cmp compare if w0 is not zero then it goes to .L4 which takes us to .l0 and we lose hence we want w0 to be zero
hence 90-0 =90
convert to hexadecimal 0x5A




## Flag:

```
picoCTF{0000005a}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- learned how to read assembly language 

## Notes:

- lsl left bit shift
- sdiv for division
- sub for subtraction
