# 4. sweethaven:
To build and start.
First `cd` into the `src` directory. Then run:
docker-compose up --build -d
The website will be accessible at http://localhost:1234 After solving locally, access the challenge server at http://sweethaven.nitephase.live:57889


## FLag:
```
nite{s5t1_w17h_un1c0d3_35c4p3_byp455}
```

## Approach:
- First accessed http://localhost:1234 locally on my machine.
- Logined by clicking on ``` Register Here ``` and typing any login credentials.
- I got to know that we need to perform SSTI injection into this review box to reveal the flag.
- I tried some ``` ${7=7) ```, this injections added the below review ``` Best coffee I had ```
- Studied the code from ``` app.py ``` script noticed that it decodes the escape sequences as ``` review = ( bytes(review, "utf-8").decode("unicode_escape") ) ```
- So I replaced ``` $ ``` with ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN} ``` and tried injecting using ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN}{7*7} ``` and 49 was added in the review
- - I got a SSTI payload ``` ${cycler._init.globals_.os.environ} ``` which I replaced with ``` \N{DOLLAR SIGN}{cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.environ} ``` and got the useful metadat.
After this, I opened the actual challenge site andd applied the same the got the flag.
